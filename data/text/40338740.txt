Dear US citizens£º
First of all, wish you all have a happy holiday. But while you are celebrating your
holiday, have you ever thought of the Chinese flier, Wang Wei. Where is he now? While you
are gathering with your families, have u ever thought of what his family is feeling now?
Everyone has his own lovers, children, and his own family. As Chinese, we love our country
and our people deeply. When our country suffered from the imperialism, we are inflamed. We
can only say, 'Our country, whenever you need us, we will sacrifice all we have without
any hesitation, include our lives.'
We want peace, but we will never be prostrated by the US power.
We feel proud of our lovable hero, the Chinese flier, Wang Wei.
