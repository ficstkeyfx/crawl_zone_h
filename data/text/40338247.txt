NOT DELETE ONLY DEFACE If you are still shocked with the images of the 11/09, take advantage of to do 1 minute of silence in honor to the American suppositions 5 thousand, most civil innocent, died cowardly by terrorists that it is not known for who you/they are sure. Since you are in silence, be quiet more 13 minutes in honor to the dead Iraquian 130 thousand in 1991 for the bush father's order. Take advantage of to remind that in that occasion the Americans also made party as the Palestinian did. Amend more 20 minutes for the Iranian 200 thousand died by the Irakis with weapons and supplied money Sadan Hussein (still brand new at that time) for the same Americans that later would turn its artillery against him. Plus 15 minutes for the Russians and Afghan 150 thousand died by the taliban, also with weapons and American money. Plus 10 minutes for 100.000 dead Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagazaki, also for action of the eagle. Ready you are already in silence 1 hour (1 minute for the Americans and 59 for its victims) If you are still perplexed it is more 1 hour in silence for the deads in the war of Vietnam, and who knows more some days for the thousands of people that live in full poverty for everyone dying for the hunger and resulting diseases of the predatory politics of the USA. It had taken, that the Americans begin to understand that they are also vulnerable, and that the tragedies that they provoke are so barbaric and cowards as the one of the other ones. The deads of the other people hurt so much as the one of them.
