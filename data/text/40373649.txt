asked Oct 14 in Cloud Mining by admin (7.7k points)
Ethereum cloud mining contracts at Hashgains start from $125 for 5 MH/s mining hash rate up to $1,250 for 50 mH/s and the contracts last for 24 months. Hence, it is quite cheap compared to Genesis Mining cloud mining platform, but almost the same value per hash rate. Another benefit over Genesis Mining is that its packages seem many.
The company’s parent firm Cyfuture has 15 years of experience providing data center services to 10 Fortune 500 companies.
According to the website, the company’s mining data centers utilize green energy. The mining farms are located in China and India. Mining will start within 24-72 hours of the payment being verified. The rewards will be transferred to your wallet once the minimum mining threshold is reached. However, the process is not automated currently.
