Saturday, September 13, 2003I havent updated in a long ass time... so ya...umm, fuck this . school is a pain in the ass like dropping the soap in prison, with 12 other convicted sexual offenders. I wnat to go to Paton, but unfortunatly they do not except transfers coz' they over accepted so fuck.  I hate my school.  By the way, I'm probably going to be pissing off some people or persons soon, so be forwarned, and dont think that i meant to fuck over your life or anything.3:43 AM - 1 view - 7 eprops - 4 comments - email itThursday, July 17, 2003HOW TO FOOL XANGA:A 5 part study by Nikesh Patel about the operations Xanga.com uses to sign in users, and the different methods one may fool or bypass them.Outline:1.)

Thank you.1:10 PM - 1 view - 9 eprops - 9 comments - email itWednesday, July 16, 2003Ramp Update:I have modified the dimensions once again due tot he space restrictions of my backyard.
The width is now looking like its gonna be 8 feet, and the length might be round 20-22 feet.
The extension and the ledge aren't looking so good anymore, because as I keep playing with the dimensions, I have realized that I'm gonna have hardly any space on the decks.
A plain old rail might work better, as far as space restrictions go.
As for the extension, I'm getting a better feel for how high 3 feet is really gonna be speed wise.Does anyone know how high the Windword ramp is?
If anyone has the dimensions ( L x W x H ), It would be a very beautiful thing if you could get those to me.Anywho, comment with ideas.8:41 PM - 1 view - add eprops - add comments - email itMonday, July 14, 2003I have chosen to mirror a site that was defaced yesterday.
Defacement is when someone hijacks a website and posts their own webpage, known as defacing it.
Defacement is one of the more well known forms of hacking, and one that I think can be used in a variety of ways.
As seen in this example, people can post their own opinions on certain topics and political issues that would otherwise not be talked about.In this case, the topic is about the United States' and others war on the beliefes and structures of the Islamic world.
My cultural background is Hindu.
There are many conflicts oing on between the Hindu world and the Islamic world that have been going on for centuries.
I do not follow Hinduism, nor do I hate Islam.
What I hate is people who hate other religions and cultures without aquiring any historical of ethnic background on the people who they hate.
This defacement also covers the aggression of Isreal towards other Middle Eastern countries.
Isreal has oppressed people of other countries for many years, and the vast majority of other Middle Eastern countries have carried a strong hatered towords Isreal for a very long time.
The United States endorses Isreal because of its political value as an ally.
There is hardly ever an media coverrage of the oppression of the Palastinian people that the Isrealies endorse upon them in the United States.
Why?
Because Buch dosen't care about the Palestinian people, or their cultures and beleifes.
Bush thinks that just because the Palestinian people are different from him and the Isrealies,they are extremists and need to be liberated.
Do you know who this reminds me of? Adolph Hitler.You can see this site I have mirrored by scrolling down past my previouse posts.2:20 PM - 1 view - add eprops - add comments - email itFriday, July 11, 2003Ramp Update:Plans have been delayed because my sister has been using the entire backyard to paint her door, closet doors, her shelving, herself, and other random objects, so i haven't been able to use it.
HOWEVER, I have been talking with my paretns (aka. my dad) and he says that I can prbly start the foundation layout the end of next week.
I won't be calling anyone to help though, or at least not for now.
i will begin to ask for help when i have the decks (not including the extenion) up and then length and width already built into the framwork.
This will prbly be done in around 2 weeks from now.
I will be posting plans of the ramp this week, so keep aneye out for em'.
Surrently i have a 3 to 4 foot high mini-pipe, around 20 feet long, and around 10 feet wide.
i plan to have a 2 foot extension, making the dropin from the ext. around 5 -6 feet.
On the decks opposite the ext. will be a grind/stall bench/ledge, 5 feet long and prbly 1.5 -2 feet high.
Maybe railing on the decks, depends on the time and how much extra wood we have left over.7:52 PM - 1 view - 10 eprops - 5 comments - email itNext 5 >>

1. Why a nun can be covered from head to toe and she's respected for devoting her self to GOD, And When a MUSLIMAH does that she is "oppressed"?
2. Why a Jew can grow a beared and he's just practicing his faith, and when a MUSLIM does that he is extremist ?
3. When a Western Woman stays at home to look after the house and kids she's sacrificing herself and doing good for the house hold, but when a mouslim woman does so, she "needs to be liberated" ?
4. Why is that when a child dedicates himself to a subject, he has potential, and when a child dedicates him self to ISLAM, he isHOPELESS ?
5. WHEN A CHRISTIAN OR JEW KILLS SOMEONE, RELIGION IS NOT MENTIONED, BUT WHEN A MUSLIM IS CHARGED WITH A CRIME, IT IS ISLAM THAT GOES TO TRIAL ?
why more people die U.S.A ?
Long Life palestine and Islam Lands allah akbar allah akbar
