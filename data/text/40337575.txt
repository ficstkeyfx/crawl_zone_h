hax0rs lab owned again
I've got no patience now, so sick of complacence
now
Sick of sick of you. Time has come to play
Yes, I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to
fight me
Compromise, conformity, assimilation,
submission, ignorance, hypocrisy,
brutality, the elite
All of which are american dreams
We gotta take the power back
