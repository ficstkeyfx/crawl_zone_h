why do we hack?
We hack 'cause we r fighting against bad information,
all of us ain't terrorists,
or stupid boyz who don't
know what they're doing.
We're just some guys, maybe
we've grown fastly,
but we're curious. Is it a crime
2 b interested
in
learning?
Each of
us has an own
life,
which can b good or bad.
We don't like 2 live
in
misinformation
or
ignorance.
We
want a better
world;
a
world
where
there
ain't
inequalities,
differences, injustices:
a new world!
We don't want
that
the
world
will
b
guided
by
multinational
companies, we don't want a world like this. Our world
has
2
b
of
everyone
who
passes
his/her
own
believings, religions, races,
politic ideas,
social
conditions
and
everything
which
makes differences
between people.
We want this, and we're fighting for
this.
We r against each
kind
of war,
against each
kind of
oppression,
against each
form of
abuse of
power:
we're fighting
and we'll fight in each place
where the
individual freedom is threatened.
We will
fight
under
each
flag besides people we don't even
know
but
whose idea of
freedom
is the same of our
one.
We
haven't
open
access
2
the
means
of
communication which r false,
they say what they want
and in
the way
they prefer,
this is the only way 2
spread
our ideas.
Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Serbia,
Iran,
Iraq,
Afghanistan,
Chile,
Peru,
Myanmar,
Brazil,
Philippines,
Palestine,
India,
Pakistan,
Kurdistan,
Turkey,
Algeria,
South
Africa,
China,
Taiwan,
Chechnya r places
where freedom is a dream,
open
your eyes,
open
your
mind, wake up,
and all
toghether
we'll turn freedom
from
dream 2 reality.
You
can agree
with us or not.
If you agree with us
let
diffuse
this
message
2 make our
ideas become
everybody's ideas.
special thanx to:
GForce Pakistan, Wfd and all the people who support us:
We're fighting for the same ideals, we're fighting for the
freedom in all the countries where itsn't. We don't live,
luckily, in countries where there isn't freedom but we know its
value and we fight in memory of all people that was dead to reach
this ideal. Now the people that was dead in its name are called
stupid but the history will call them: heroes!
