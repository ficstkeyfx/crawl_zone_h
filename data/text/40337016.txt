Our message: We are against all forms of terrorism, discrimination, social injustice, and moreover , we are very much concerned with the lives of thousands of innocent people which die every year because of starvation, in countries like :Brasil,Angola, Bangladesh, Iraq, and others.
For this reason, we appeal the international communitty to consider this issue more seriously,there is enough for all of us.we also stand against the microsoft monopoly, and the way Bill gates uses his money
For you , dear reader, if you think you are just a simple soul in this world, and cannot do anything for those people, but you whish, we would like to say the following:just the fact that you take this issue deep into consideration, and you be aware about it as you talk with other people about this issue,and in the way you gonna handle this issue in your live, its a great of help
thanx, for reading.
Say no to child slavery, say no to exploration,ocupation,starvation,and human rights abuses
