Sysadmin Message
I know that you may not even uderstand what the hell this means, but, i
have not tampered with any of ur other files, other then editing my logs
and this page that u see before you. The original file has been moved to
index2.html in the same directory. I suggest that ur government spends
more time on keeping on top of their computer security, because there is a
cyber war going on, and u have just been another casuality of war.
