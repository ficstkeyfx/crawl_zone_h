Hacked This Site :)
Dear defacers,
I'd just like to
say some words about egypt. Hacking from egypt is real fun guys.
you dont have to worry about FBI or so, coz there'snt any or
maybe hacking isnt considered a crime here yet. you dont have to
go through chains of proxies, connect directly to your target
with your bare ip, just disconnect , come back and you get your
new ip addresse :) and dont worry, they wont keep the logs , it
eats up disk space you know lol. even if you got caught ( and it
never happened before ) i dont think there are any rules against
hacking yet.
Am just saying
this hoping they wake up or something

patch
