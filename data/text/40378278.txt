Wellcome to Cloud Platform!

Bioinformatics Centre at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU, formerly University of Pune) was established in 1987 as a Distributed Information Centre (DIC) under the Biotechnology Information System Network (BTISNET) established by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt. of India. Ever since its inception, the Centre has made perceptible impact towards the growth of the discipline of Bioinformatics at the national and international levels. As a culmination of this, the Centre is conferred with the status of the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bioinformatics by the DBT (2002 - till date). It also has a distinction of being recognised as the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bioinformatics by the Department of Electronics & Information Technology (DeitY), Govt. of India during 2008-2013. The centre is equipped with the-state-of-the-art infrastructure and a specialised library. The faculty & the students at the Centre are engaged in carrying out cutting-edge research in various areas of Bioinformatics with a special focus on ViroInformatics and Structural Bioinformatics. The mission of the Bioinformatics Centre at SPPU has been and continues to be a nationally acclaimed and internationally recognised premier institution of higher education and research in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.
The Centre is known for its contributions in R&D and has developed several algorithms, servers and databases which are extensively used by the scientific community. Some of these indigenous algorithms and databases are the firsts in respective categories and have made a significant impact nationally and internationally. The centre has an impressive record of publications, citations and usage statistics for its servers and databases.
The Centre is happy to announce launch of the cloud platform to host the databases and servers and profusely acknowledges Centre for Information & Network Security (CINS), Savitribai Phule Pune University for coming forward to develop cloud and related facilities dedicated to Bioinformatics. With Bioinformatics Centre, CINS@SPPU is also successfully launching cloud environment for the first time on SPPU campus!
