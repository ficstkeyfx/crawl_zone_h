Hackers rule the internet world, we are everywhere,
one gets in trouble 3 more pop up and so on. We break into systems and fix the hole we
used to penetrate. We are here to help, we don't delete files, if anything be back them
up, You could basically call us security analyzers with a sense of humor. Also The
Fallen Angels, I have nothing against you all but please do not re-do my sites, is all
I ask, And more, About war and racism, and all the BS that goes on around us, why? Why
can't it all stop? Why can't there just be 100% peace? We resolve problems with violence,
but does that solve anything? No, Because even after you have one a war, another much more
violent one comes up and history repeats. Everyone deserves to be treat them same,
everyone deserves a home and everybody has the right to their opinion. Also, Kevin Mitnick
AKA Condor has been imprisoned and kept away from computer equipment for 5 years, isn't
that long enough? Finally gets a court date and it is held off to a further time, this is
BS, that is wrong.
