every official that come in
cripples us leaves us maimed
silent and tainted
and with our flesh and bones
he builds his homes
southern fist
rise though tha jungle mist
clenched to smash power so cancerous
a black flag and a red star
a rising sun loomin over los angeles cause for raza livin in La La
is like gaza on to tha dawn of intifada
eached for tha lessons tha masked pass on
and seize tha metropolis
its you that its built on
everything can change on a new years day
as everything changed on a new years day
everything can change on a new years day
as everything changed on a new years day
war within a breath
its land or death
their existance is a crime
their seat their robe their tie
their land deeds
their hired guns
theyre the crime
bah.. i dont wanna get carpal tunnel from typing this. :/
