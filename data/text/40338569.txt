We Be Right Back
Defacer from Malaysia Owned By Gbs ARemiey And J3bat DUrh4ka "WE LIVE FOR NOTHING , WE DIE FOR SOMETHING"
Hello, first of all I want to say that your security is LOW! Secondly, do not accused the hackers of creating fake emails or hacked the governmentâs money because we never did it. It is all the Government's agenda! The government is trying to give a bad name to the Malaysian hackers. This is because they want to make a false report. It was not the hackers who steal the money. The Government did it for their own sake! Do not blame us, blame yourself. Thirdly, we came here with responsiblility to tell people on where is the money had gone! This is the studentsâ voice! They are uncomfortable with public facilities, places, foods and drinks. So think and reflect onward Malaysia country! We Are Anonymous, We Are Legion, We do not forgive, We do not forget, Expect Us! You are being watched ..! Remember the name.
