admin: no files were deleted besides logs, index backed up, hole was
patched
This site has been held up by RSH with no msg in mind but the
prowdness
that we have the type of  people in our group that can do shit like
this. I am Happy_Hardcor3 and I think that there really should be no
message
to a deface I think it should be plain and simple that it should be kept
short and sweet which is normally what I do when I make a defacement for
a site.
So if you have different thoughts on how a deface should be then find
me and tell me about it untill then I will respect your thought and you
will respect mine.
