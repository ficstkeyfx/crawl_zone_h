Welcome to Lene Marlin's (owned) Site
Lene Marlin.
I had to dot-slash this site to tell the world
about a really, really special girl i've been together with
for about 3 months...
I lived in a dark world without hope or
light
I doubted the faith which was supposed to bring me my future
Your touch made me start living
You made me smile, made me feel special
You made me feel wanted and good
All I wan't to do is hug you and experience things with you
I don't know how I can find enough time to spend with you
Nor how to find enough words to express my feeling for you..
Atleast you've won a piece of my heart and that's a great thing to
do
Oh, and Lene marlin, i own you?
