Takeaway.com welcomes security researchers to review our public-facing defenses with an objective, professional eye. Earn rewards, bragging rights, and security experience to level up!
We do not want to hide our mistakes, but please allow us to take appropriate measures before disclosing any vulnerabilities to the outside world.
Ratings/Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd
Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a
vulnerability priority will be modified by us due to its likelihood or impact. The main
criteria here are certain risks with regard to Takeaway.com's platform and business. In
some cases, we also consider the amount of effort required to identify a vulnerability
(i.e., we typically do not appreciate submissions based solely on the results of
automated scans, unless it reveals something really interesting). In instances where an
issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher,
along with the opportunity to appeal and make a case for a higher priority. Rewards for
this program are currently split into 2 groups in terms of scope, to help the
researchers focus more on the important parts for our business flow. You can find the
respective ranges for each group below.
Scope and rewards
Takeaway Group 1 Targets (In Scope)
In scope
Important notes for targets:
All main domains (takeaway.com, lieferando.de, thuisbezorgd.nl etc.; you can check if it redirects to a page with same functionality) have the same codebase behind them and thus, identical vulnerabilities on different main domains and on their subdomains will be treated as duplicates.
If a subdomain or a path of a wildcard (*) URL in Group 1 is also defined under Group 2, that subdomain (or path) should be considered Group 2.

Takeaway Out of Scope Targets
Out of scope
Any domain/property of Takeaway not listed in the targets section is out of scope. This includes any/all subdomains not listed above.

Testing is only authorized on the targets listed as In-Scope. Any domain/property of Takeaway not listed in the targets section is out of scope. This includes any/all subdomains not listed above. If you believe you've identified a vulnerability on a system outside the scope, please reach out to support@bugcrowd.com before submitting.
There are 3 test restaurants dedicated to security assessments, which can be used to test ordering:
BugCrowd NL in the zip area 8888
BugCrowd DE in the zip area 88888 (if its not working add ?showTestRestaurants=true at the end of the URL)
BugCrowd PL in the zip area 88-888
Please place test orders exclusively using these properly labelled test restaurants. Kindly note that the principal domains have the same codebase behind them and thus, identical vulnerabilities on different main domains and on their subdomains will be treated as duplicates.
For certain API endpoints you can access the test restaurans by adding the following POST parameter to your request: var10=1
Blackbox Targets
The below targets are part of business2business portal which allows companies to manage monthly and daily allowances paid by the company for their employees when those order food on our platform. Testing them is considered in scope but credentials will not be provided for these targets specifically.

Focus Areas
We encourage researchers to focus their efforts in the following areas:
Business Logic Flaws
Exfiltration of Sensitive or Personal Data
Remote Code Execution
SQL and Command Injection
Authentication Bypass
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in sensitive functions
Out of scope
Multiple recurrences of the same vulnerability on different domains will be treated as the same issue.
We are already aware of issues related to rate limiting in the authentication subsystem
Google Maps API keys
Session valid after logout and password change/reset
Cookie expiration
Software version disclosure
Same site scripting
Social engineering and phishing
Multiple recurrences of the same vulnerability on different domains
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) in non-sensitive functions
Missing/misconfigured SPF/DMARC DNS-records
Denial of service or resource exhaustion attacks (but such vulnerabilities in proprietary applications should be reported)
Weak or misconfigured SSL/TLS parameters
Content spoofing
Issues related to rate limiting in the authentication subsystem
Issues related to cross-domain policies for software such as Wordpress, Silverlight, etc. without evidence of an exploitable vulnerability
Vulnerabilities that are limited to unsupported browsers will not be accepted (i.e. "this exploit only works in IE6/IE7")
Username / email enumeration, password guessing and exposed API interfaces (like xmlrpc.php) in standard software (i.e. Wordpress)
Vulnerabilities that require a large amount of user cooperation to perform, unlikely or unreasonable actions which would be more symptomatic of a social engineering or phishing attack and not an application vulnerability (e.g. disabling browser security features, sending the attacker critical information to complete the attack, etc.)
Eligibility:
Takeaway.com employees (including former employees that separated from Takeaway.com within the prior 12 months), contingent workers, contractors and their personnel, and consultants, as well as their immediate family members and persons living in the same household are not eligible to receive bounties or rewards of any kind under this program.
Safe Harbor:
When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider this research to be:
Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis for work done under this policy; and
Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.
You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.
If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please inquire via support@bugcrowd.com before going any further.
