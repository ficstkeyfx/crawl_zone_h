We Believe What We Achieve
Our aim is to increase preparedness of children and their families for emergency situations in the aftermath of natural disasters through child-centred and community-based approaches. We also aim to manage disasters better, minimise the impact of natural disasters to communities in disaster prone areas and build child-centred resilient communities.
Dream kidz Foundation wishes to receive proposals from interested health workers, investigators, or community organizations for innovative research or innovative service projects directed at improving the health of infants, children, leprosy, slum, trible gypsy, aids and pregnant women.

Certificate Of Registration
Acknowledged and certified the good work being done by ISO.Dream Kidz Foundation is a home to orphans and abandoned children from anywhere in the city or out of the city. Care & Love is the benchmark for making the lives of these children the happiest and most memorable. The organisation strives to help these children both for their physical needs - nutritious food, shelter, education and reliable healthcare and emotional needs irrespective of their religion and social caste.
90% of our total operating expenses fund programs for children in the city we serve. So when you make a monthly gift or donation to our organization, the majority of your rupees go toward exactly what you intended - supporting children in poverty.
MISSION
Our mission is to help children in need, who have been identified as high achievers, remain in school.
VISION
Our Vision is that we believe that education can move a child beyond the stigma of poverty, and give that child the tools to reach his or her true and full potential.
